# Zadanie-rekrutacyjne
Application was created using React with plain javascript as recruitment task.

Application supports system dark-mode as well as mobile devices.

To run the application you need to type "npm install" and "npm run dev" in the terminal in the "zadanie rekrutacyjne" directory.

Application is meant to sort posts by the most interesting (title length), I also added the feature to sort posts by least interesting, to do so you need to click one of the buttons at the top of the page.
